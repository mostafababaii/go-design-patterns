# Bulkheads Pattern

The **Bulkheads pattern** in Golang is a design principle used to improve system resilience and fault tolerance. It is named after the watertight compartments on ships, known as bulkheads, which prevent flooding from spreading throughout the vessel.

In the context of software, the Bulkheads pattern involves isolating components or resources within a system into separate 'compartments'. This isolation helps to contain failures within a single area, preventing them from affecting the entire system.

For example, by using separate goroutine pools for different tasks, if one pool gets overloaded or encounters an error, it won't impact the others, thus maintaining the overall stability and reliability of the application.

The Bulkheads pattern is particularly useful in microservices architecture where different services can operate independently, ensuring that the failure of a single service does not cause a system-wide outage.
